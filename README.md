### Quick Commands to Get Rolling 🛠️

If you're eager to get going, these commands will come in handy:

```
cd little-picasso/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Run LittlePicasso Locally  🏠

To give LittlePicasso a whirl on your local system, use:

# This starts the Internet Computer replica in the background
```
dfx start --background
```
# Deploy your canisters to the local replica and create the candid interface
```
dfx deploy
```

After the setup, LittlePicasso will be live at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Keep Your Canisters Fresh 🔄

When you tweak the backend canister:

```
npm run generate
```
Do this before you fire up the frontend dev server. It's a good practice and also a step that's auto-magically handled whenever you run `dfx deploy`.

For Frontend Wizards 🧙‍♂️

If you're crafting the frontend:

```
npm start
```
This enchantment summons a dev server at `http://localhost:8080`, which conjures API requests to the local replica at port 4943.
